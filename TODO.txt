
TODO:
==============

- Add {@nx.block.hidden that would hide in javadoc, but eligible for includes 
  in other classes.

- Maybe: allows {@link } blocks to support strong typing
  and avoid bad links.. When not using taglets, it would remain
  an actual link.

- Add equiv. of "trimToNull" to "PropertyMatchers" so that blank values
  could be treated as null (i.e., non-existant).

- Maybe: have CachedStreamFactory set itself on current thread (but not 
  overwriting it on parent thread).

- Modify Jar copier to handle cases where snapshot are timestamped instead and
  not being considered the latest when they should.  Like:
  norconex-commons-lang-1.13.0-20170328.184247-17.jar vs 
  norconex-commons-lang-1.13.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  https://github.com/Norconex/collector-http/issues/331#issuecomment-290196986

- Deploy javadoc for each version but have latest also accessible as "current"

- Check why URLNormalizer.removeFragment is so expensive compared to
  other basic operations (as reported by Sylvain Roussy using JProfiler).

LOWER:
--------------

- Use nill/nillable for null handling, as desribed here:
  https://kiranscope.blogspot.com/2009/03/blank-space-or-null-string-validation.html

- DONE? Add feature and tests for when parent element is specified but has no
  value, which means blanking a list 
  (e.g. HTTP Collector: StandardSitemapResolverTest).

- Make Properties and XML take a IConverter as constructor agreement, but 
  default to Converter static instance.

- Remove all classes that are already part of Apache Commons.

- Consider using Apache Commons Exec to replace SystemCommand if latest Java
  features are not enough.

- Allows to specify a velocity-tools.properties or equivalent in classpath
  root (e.g. classes/ folder) to define custom classes/tools to be used 
  by Velocity.
  

MAYBE/IDEAS:
--------------

- MAYBE modify assembly to use licenses.xml instead of THIRD-PARTY?
  (the second is easier to read for non-techies)  

- Reduce dependencies wherever possible.
